# Prediction-of-LC50-value-using-Quantitative-structure-activity-relationship-models---QSAR-models
The goal here is to build an end-to-end automated Machine Learning model that predicts the LC50 value, the concentration of a compound that causes 50% lethality of fish in a test batch over a duration of 96 hours, using 6 given molecular descriptors.
